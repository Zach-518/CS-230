1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? **The Gaming Room contracted us to expand their gamed Draw It or Lose It. We were to develop a web-based version of the game with multiplayer functionality.<br />**
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? **I think I did a decent job of interpreting the domain model and analyzing all of the OOP principles in place.<br />**
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? **Having the specific requirements and points of interest laid out plainly for me to see helped me keep track of the bigger picture while I worked on the code.<br />**
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? **I would go back and revise the design constraints. In hindsight there is a lot more I could have talked about that is important.<br />**
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? **We took the user's needs and broke them down into very specific requirements to complete the project and constraints that narrowed our direction of the project. I think this is important because it gives us a clear picture of what exactly we need to do to deliver a viable product to our client.<br />**
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? **For me it was a lot of research as I used this as a learning strategy to strengthen my more core concepts. I would keep the documentation open and read into everything new I came across. The way the class was structured also gave me the benefit of taking everything one logical step at a time, and I think that is important for any future projects to keep everything in perspective.<br />**
